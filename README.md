# Pravda

This tool provides exercices in formal logic, more precisely for proof systems.  You can have a look at the following address: http://pravda.irisa.fr/

## Building the tool
Be sure to have installed tsc, the TypeScript compiler.
Run `tsc` in the root folder.
The release version is then in the folder `dist`. You may launch it with `python -m http.server`.


## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Thibaut Antoine for having developed the module for sequent calculus.
